Art Gallery for Carthryn Gruhn

This is a simple art gallery application that will display the users art work and allow them to add new work or delete recent work. It will include an admin page that will allow the user to log in and make these changes.

There is no link on the homepage for the admin.php file as I only wanted the owner to know of it. 

Members Area (admin-area.php) includes -
  1. Password change
  2. Upload new images that automatically display in gallery without page reload
  3. Update owner information in the About section 
  4. Update owner profile image in the About section
